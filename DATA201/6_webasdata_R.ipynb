    "Sometimes you are fortunate enought that the information you are looking for is provided by a website through an API. This is a somewhat open ended exercise. The first one you encounter in this labs, but now you are grown up. We ask you to _pull_ data from an API of your choice, do some simple wrangling (and some super simple analysis if you really want) and visualize your result.\n",
    "\n",
    "The focus of the exercise is on the interaction with the API you chose, not so much the visualization. We would like to see that you did some complex query in a programmatic fashion (that is, not by hand-writing the query but using a function to do that for you).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some possible APIs you can use are (in order of what-Giulio-likes):\n",
    "\n",
    "* digitalnz [API](https://digitalnz.org/developers) get cultural, education and gov data from NZ. It contains many different API. Some of them require authentification and/or subscription (a good one is the DOC [campsites and huts](https://api.doc.govt.nz) api).\n",
    "* [Geonet](https://api.geonet.org.nz/) for geological hazard information\n",
    "* [Trademe](https://developer.trademe.co.nz/) very nice one, but not supereasy to get the autentification done (this [queries](https://developer.trademe.co.nz/api-reference/catalogue-methods/) do not require auth).\n",
    "* all of thise [references](https://www.programmableweb.com/category/reference/api) APIs are (probably, I did not check ALL of them) good examples.\n",
    "* [GDELT](https://blog.gdeltproject.org/gdelt-geo-2-0-api-debuts/) This is a rewarding, yet **tough**, API. Take a look at [leaflet](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/json.html) for an idea on how to use what you get back from GDELT. Also, Alex Bresler has started working on an [R wrapper](https://github.com/abresler/gdeltr2) that may get you inspired.\n",
    "* [car2go](https://github.com/car2go/openAPI) (requires [registration](https://github.com/car2go/openAPI/wiki/Access-protected-Functions-via-OAuth-1.0#registration-as-consumer))\n",
    "* [Quandl](https://www.quandl.com/docs/api)\n",
    "* [Lufthansa](https://developer.lufthansa.com/docs) most methods are open, so good one if you don't want to deal with authentification.\n",

    "\n",
    "Many website returns JSON files when you query them. Json is similar to the XML (of which HTML is an example) in that it is a **tree** (not tabular nor relational) data format. Roughly speaking, it is a list of lists of lists of ... `purrr` is very handy when you want to extract information from a JSON file. But do see also the `jsonlite` package, [intro here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/jsonlite/vignettes/json-aaquickstart.html). If you are lost trying to wrangle the results you get from these APIs, consider working through Jenny Brian's [tutorial on purrr](https://jennybc.github.io/purrr-tutorial/ex26_ny-food-market-json.html).
