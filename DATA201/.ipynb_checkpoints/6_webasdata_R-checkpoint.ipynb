The idea is to attribute to each word a score, expressing wether it's more negative and positive, and then to sum up all the word values in a song: the result will give us a first approximation to the song general mood. To do this, we are going to use Julia Silge's and David Robinson's great [_Tidytext_](https://github.com/juliasilge/tidytext) library and a _vocabulary_ of words for which we have the scores (there are different options, we are using \"afinn\")."
